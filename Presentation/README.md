# Presentation

Since the dashboard was created in order to help the marketing department of the *Sterling & Draper advertising agency*, the added presentation is showcasing the dashboard's uses & analyzes the data its charts withheld.<br>
There are two versions of this presentation in the current folder, `PowerPoint` & `PDF`:
1. The original `PowerPoint` presentation's attached charts were embedded directly from Tableau, ***thus all of its visualizations are <ins>interactive</ins>***.
2. The `PDF` version does not support the interactiveness hence the embedded charts will function as static charts in it.

###### ***In order to activate interactiveness with the embedded charts - Left click a chart inside a slide.<br> All other Tableau controls like zooming in/out (CTRL + Mousewheel) are functioning exactly the same as they function while interacting with Tableau dashboards.***
